# Step 1: Download a browser

# Step 3: Create a Home for your current and future projects
It's easy to forget where you saved a file, especially when you start coding, so let's start by creating a folder on your desktop called `Code`. See below for example:

Create a new folder inside code and name your project. I am going to call mine `gDay` <3

# Step 4: Create an `index.html` file and save in `Code` folder
Open your new code editor, copy and paste this HTML template code into a new file:
```<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Happy Galentine's Day</title>
</head>

<body>
// Our code is going to go here!
</body>
</html>
```
Save as `index.html` into your new `gDay` folder

# Step 5: Create and save a CSS file called `styles.css` in the same folder as your `index.html` file

# Step 6: Reference your CSS file in `index.html` in between the open and closing `<head>` tags. It should look exactly like this:

```
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Happy Galentine's Day</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

# Step 7: Let's write our first piece of code!

Add a `header` tag with a celebratory Galentine's day message (e.g. Happy Galentine's Day!) inside the opening and closing `<body>` tags. It should look something like this:

```
<body>
  <h1>Happy Galentine's Day!</<h1>
</body>
```

Hint: The number after the `h` in the tag corresponds to the size of the header :)
