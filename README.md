# Step 3: Create a Home for your Code
It's easy to forget where you saved a file, especially when you start coding, so let's start by creating a folder on your desktop called `Code`. See below for example:

# Step 4: Create an `index.html` file and save in `Code` folder
Open your new code editor, copy and paste this `index.html` template code into a new file:
```<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Happy Galentine's Day</title>
</head>

<body>
// Our code is going to go here!
</body>
</html>
```
Save as `index.html` into your new `Code` folder
